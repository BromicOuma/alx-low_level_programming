# C - Variables, if, else, while

In this project, I learned about using arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean operators in C. Additionally, I practiced declaring and defining variables of type char, int, and unsigned int, using if and if...else statements, and implementing while loops.

1. **[positive_or_negative.c:](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)**

C program that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive or negative, followed by a new line:
Completion of this source code.
Stores a different random number every time the program is run.
Prints the number followed by is positive if the number is greater than 0, is zero if the number is zero, or is negative if the number is less than 0.

2. **[1-last_digit.c:](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)** 

C program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number, followed by a new line:
Completion of this source code.
Stores a different value every time the program is run.
Prints the string Last digit of [number] is [last_digit] and is followed by greater than 5 if the digit is greater than 5, 0 if the digit is 0, or less than 6 and not 0 if the digit is less than 6 and not 0.


3. **[print_alphabet.c:](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)** 

C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice.


4. **[print_alphabets.c:](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c)** 

C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, then in uppercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly three times.

5. **[print_alphabt.c:](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)**
 
 C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase except for the letters q and e, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice.


6. **[print_numbers.c:](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)** 

C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.


7. **[print_numberz.c:](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)**

C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice without any variables of type char.


8. **[print_tebahpla.c:](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)** 

C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice.


9. **[print_base16.c:](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)**

C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly three times.


10. **[print_comb.c:](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)** 

C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, using only the putchar function exactly four times without any variables of type char:
Numbers are separated by ,, followed by a space.
Numbers are printed in ascending order.
10. 00...99
