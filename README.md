# Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm project at ALX in collaboration with Holberton School. In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned and implemented projects on algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific projects are outlined as  follows:

## Requirements
The files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

The code should use the Betty style. It was checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

## Projects
* [0x00. C - Hello, World](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-hello_world)
* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while)
* [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops)
* [0x03. C - Debugging](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x03-debugging)
* [0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
* [0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings](https://github.com/BromicOuma/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings)
